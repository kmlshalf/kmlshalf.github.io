			<div class="smalltext">
				<p>I graduated in May 2020 from UC Berkeley with a degree in Cognitive Science, minor in Computer Science, and certificate in Design Innovation. </p>
				<p>I like to explore and learn deeply about new things.  Internet rabbitholes are a regular occurence for me; once I’m hooked on a subject, I start investigating every nook and cranny i can find.  This has served me well in the area of design, where so many things are still undefined and so many people are still learning.  I know that there’s always more than one way to approach something, and so have broadened my own perspectives on the world around me.</p>
				<p>My expertise mainly lies in digital design (visual design, UX design, and front-end coding), but I am always open to and interested in new areas.  I have a soft spot in my heart for museums and hands-on education, which I see as an intersection point for my favorite subjects: cognitive science, education, design, and technology.  I hope to one day translate this love into creating interactive learning experiences for people of all ages.</p>
				<p>I'm currently on the hunt for my next gig.  If you have any openings, I'd love to chat!  You can reach me at <a href="mailto:kmlshalf@gmail.com">kmlshalf@gmail.com</a>.</p>
